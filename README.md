This repository is for Rocket Evaluation (a Chrome Extension). This extension is being developed to accelerate evaluation processes and standardize evaluation texts for WGU Evaluation Faculty. This is a work in progress and by no means complete. If you have suggestions or feedback, please feel free to email me. -Thanks

****Rocket Evaluation Extension Installation****

To install the Rocket Evaluation extension in Chrome:
-Download the project files into a folder.
-Open Chrome and navigate to Menu >> More tools >> Extensions.
-In the Extensions tab click "Load Unpacked" and select the folder where you saved the files.
-This will install the extension in developer mode. The future plan is to publish this extension in the Google store.

****Adding CRDs to the Rocket Evaluation Extension****

To add CRDs for use in the extension, you will need to edit the file background.js. Close to the bottom of the file is a template CRD object named crdXXXTaskX with pretty good comments.

If you email me the CRDs you want, I will include them in this project.

If you know some Javascript and would like to help build this project, email me and I will add you as a contributor.
